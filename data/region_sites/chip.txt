Smile and take a mind-snap!

This mountain was naturally generated by a [NAI].
It simulates 10000 real life years in a second.
This whole 09xce.800f section was generated by [NAI].
Although very small in [size] this was a huge human accomplishment at the time.

6CHIP is the name of the [NAI] that generated 09xce.800f.
