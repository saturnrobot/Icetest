Outer edge of lily.town. Not as scary as it is made out to be.
detail_text;
I am in a clearing with a wooden sign infront of me with some information and a network map.{n}[lily.town] is behind me.{n}There are a variety of tall, fall coloured, trees as far as I can see forward.{n}In the distance there is a small [mountain].{n}A small dirt [path] leads into the forest.{n}A crisp breese blows.
action_words;
mountain|That would be 6chip mountain. I hear it's nothing like the mountains of other places of ///ICENET.{n}Back in the time [lily.town] was founded this probably was AI generated to simulate real life.
path|That would lead me down to [dyed.lily.town].
beacon|This is a module that allows one to jump to the closest main domain.
modules|They say you need these but it's just for the paranoid. !jump3r modules basically prevent null byte corruption.
$lyp|A outlawed module that uses null bytes to increase connection strength. It can have some trippy side effects or even memory loss.
