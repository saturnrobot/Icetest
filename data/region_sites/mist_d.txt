<3 Poetry <3
In my dreams It's paradise 
I can explore every planet,
Touch every star
Make a wish, 
Have it granted
It's so wonderful there
Up in my headspace
So why is it that here
It's as cold as ICE

This place is a cute mess {n}
Like seriously, this place is a hoarders den for all things cute

Okay, so it looks like there is a mountain of plushies to my left {n}
To my right there is literally a pile of junk {n}
I have no idea what any of this stuff is but it looks like Alice is still trying to arrange it all {n}
Further to the back it's potted flowers galore, is that one moving? {n}
In the middle of the room sits a ramp, why is that there? {n}
Upon further inspection the plushies look at that ramp with disdain {n}
The room itself is circular and covered in multiple different types of wallpapers and written poetry {n}
I hope she is just trying to decide which one looks the best {n}
Alice stands next to a couch eagerly analyzing my expression {n}
Was she always this scatterbrained?
