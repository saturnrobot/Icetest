^^^^^m^^^^^m^^^ DYED FOREST ^^m^^^^m^^^^m^^^

Forest of colour both unreal and real.
Once seen as unnatural.
Now it is as natural as wood.

Great steps were made in natural generation.
Let this stand as an example.
There is beauty on the edge, even if it is still artificial.

A forest surrounds me. It's hard to make any logical conclusion about any potential connections.{n}
There are many paths and directions...{n}

It is peaceful and unnerving at the same time.{n}
I imagine this is what being lost in a forest in the real world would feel like.{n}
Except theres no real danger here...
