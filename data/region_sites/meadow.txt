(~0~)(~0~)(~0~) LILY MEADOW (~0~)(~0~)(~0~)

This is the secret subdomain of 3ternity.

!!! The lotus church does not truly represent lily !!!
!!! The lotus church misrepresents PASTORAL WORKS II !!!

I maintain this meadow to honor Lily.
"Nature, human and software must co-exist in harmony." - LILY 9:12
(Nature here is meant both real and artificial.)
"Nature is reflected in the artificial." - LILY 10:10

Even in the digital world we must still honor the natural.

Please pay your respect with any .fty file you have.

Take an .fty leave an .fty. Thank you.
