Type whatever you want to display just raw in the text file
When you want code enter {code} and the lines below that will be read as code.
In that you will enter tags ending in semi colons:
Here are valid tags:
{code}
examine_text;
detail_text;
action_words;
characters;
objects;
connected_regions;
{code}
^ After you are done the putting in code enter {code} at the ending
The text is read like so: 
Read the tag and store it
all lines under tag are mapped to the stored tag given 
stop storing when another tag is read (a word that ENDS with a ;)

Own tags can be made if add l_tagname (where tag name is replaced with the tag) if added to a Region class

{name} - player name
{n} - new line
