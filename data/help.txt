############# WELCOME TO THE <MINIMALIST> MODE USER MANUAL #############
Minimalist mode is mainly used for servers to test applications
Lots of functionality and realism is lost when using this mode
It is suggested that normal inhabitants switch to REALISTIC mode...
(99% of users use this mode, minimalist mode has also been dropped from PD)

Minimalist mode will scan things of interest for you and highlight them
with [] around them. Like so: [tunnel]

Because of the limited power of minimalist mode users can [look] and [examine]
their current connections. When connected, the display will show the current
location converted to TXT. In REALISTIC mode these places would be actual real spaces.
